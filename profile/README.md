## Finite Sample

Practical, well‑documented tooling for applied statistics and econometrics: deployable probability calibration, exact thresholding for stepwise metrics, stable trees, projection‑pursuit dimension reduction, nonparametric smoothing, and time‑series trend estimation. Several libraries are scikit‑learn compatible; others target R directly or expose R’s capabilities to AI assistants via MCP.
